# Student-DBMS


It's a simple projects base on file written in c language and it has 2 source code. First one is for enter the data of students and that data will save permanently inside a file and its limitation is the attributes are fixed .. :) sorry for this bcz that time i was in 1st year of my B Tech... Second source code written for to retrive the data from the file.. I tried to give my best to decorate the output here..

As no one here to advice to me regarding projects so I did this one by my self.. 


Thank You.. !
